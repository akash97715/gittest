INFO:__main__:Payload: {'input': ['likely to have said that they experienced negative work impacts, along with more pronounced psychosocial impacts \nof UC, and subgroup analyses revealed that a high proportion \nof patients with vs without depression or anxiety described \ntheir health negatively. Taken together, these findings indi-\ncate that these patients seem to suffer from a particularly \nhigh disease burden and therefore may require more care \nand attention. This is supported by a population-based study \nwhere the incidence rate ratio of psychiatric comorbidity was \nsignificantly increased in patients with IBD compared with \ncontrols.5 Moreover, it has been found that patients with \nIBD who also have depression or anxiety are at an increased \nrisk of disease relapse, and these comorbidities are also risk \nfactors for poorer quality of life,21-23 while anxiety has also \nbeen linked to lower adherence to medication.24 Our findings \nalso demonstrate a delay in diagnosis for patients with de-\npression or anxiety, which may be due to patients’ reluctance \nto see physicians due to their depression or anxiety, concerns \nabout diagnosis, or potential negative outcomes from the \nappointment. Delays in diagnosis could also be due to diag-\nnostic confusion caused by overlapping symptoms, which can \nbe prevalent in patients with psychological comorbidities (eg,', 'also demonstrate a delay in diagnosis for patients with de-\npression or anxiety, which may be due to patients’ reluctance \nto see physicians due to their depression or anxiety, concerns \nabout diagnosis, or potential negative outcomes from the \nappointment. Delays in diagnosis could also be due to diag-\nnostic confusion caused by overlapping symptoms, which can \nbe prevalent in patients with psychological comorbidities (eg, \nchronic diarrhea). Furthermore, previous results suggest that \nmental health concerns in patients with UC are not routinely \naddressed2 and that almost 50% of patients did not feel com-\nfortable discussing emotional concerns with their physician.10 \nMore specific attention to mental and emotional impacts of \nUC could help to improve patient care and quality of life.\nLimitations of this analysis include a reliance on accurate \nrecall by patients and their understanding of the questions \nsurveyed, and that recruitment for the survey was based on \nself-reported diagnosis of UC, with no clinical disease ac-\ntivity assessment. This analysis also included data from 5 \ncountries compared with the 10 countries included in the \noriginal survey.2,10 Furthermore, though these results have \nbeen reported as global outcomes, the findings may not be ap-\nplicable to all countries due to regional differences in health', 'surveyed, and that recruitment for the survey was based on \nself-reported diagnosis of UC, with no clinical disease ac-\ntivity assessment.

Consequently, it is difficult to \ngeneralize these findings to the entire UC patient population. \nIn addition, a lack of data in some categories resulted in \nwide confidence intervals, which may have impacted the re-\nliability of the results. Also, some patient categories included \na wide range of patients who may have differing viewpoints, \nwhich may have influenced their responses.

For example, \nthose categorized as “not employed” included those not em-\nployed who were both looking for work and not looking \nfor work, retired participants, students, or those not em-\nployed due to disability; it is likely that retired patients may \nhave responded differently than students or patients with a \ndisability.\nIn addition, other than capturing self-identified sex, there \nwas no further analysis of patients by, for example, sexual \norientation. It is possible that heterosexual patients may \nhave responded differently than patients identifying as part \nof the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer+ community; \nhowever, further stratification of participants by sexual ori-\nentation and/or identity was not possible due to low sample \nsizes and/or a lack of data.

Lastly, it is important to \nnote that subgroup analyses do not take into account other \npotentially confounding variables, such as age, psychological \ncomorbidities, or employment status, whereas the regression \nanalysis isolates the effect from other confounding factors.\nIn conclusion, this global survey of patients with UC \nidentified substantial disparities in patient-reported \nassessments of disease management and health care experi-\nence, based on factors such as income level, employment status, \neducational level, age, sex, and psychological comorbidities. \nThese results expose the importance of addressing social \ndeterminants of health, by providing insight into the experi-\nence of patients with UC.
