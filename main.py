This analysis aimed to identify health care\n disparities, social determinants of health, and emotional impacts related to UC disease management, patient experience, and quality of life.\n\r\n\r\nMethods: The survey was conducted by The Harris Poll from August 2017 to February 2018 among adults with UC. Responses from 1000\n patients in the United States, Canada, Japan, France, and Finland were analyzed based on patient income, employment status, educational level,\n age, sex, and psychological comorbidities. Odds ratios (ORs) with significant Pvalues (P<.05) from multivariate logistic regression models are\n reported.\n\r\n\r\nResults: Low-income vs high-income patients were less likely to have participated in a peer mentoring (OR, 0.30) or UC education program (OR,\n 0.51). Patients not employed were less likely to report being in "good/excellent" health (OR, 0.58) than patients employed full time. Patients\n with low vs high educational levels were less likely to have reached out to patient associations/organizations (OR, 0.59). Patients aged younger\n than 50 years vs those aged 50 years and older were less likely to have visited an office within an inflammatory bowel disease center/clinic in\n the past 12 months (OR, 0.53). Males were less likely to be currently seeing their gastroenterologist than females (OR, 0.66). Patients with vs\n without depression were less likely to agree that UC had made them more resilient (OR, 0.51).\n\r\n\r\nConclusions: Substantial differences in disease management and health care experience were identified, based on categories pertaining to\n patient demographics and psychological comorbidities, which may help health care providers better understand and advance health equity to\n improve patient care.\n\r\n\r\nLay Summary\n\r\n\r\nPatient-reported survey results revealed substantial differences in disease management and health care experience in patients with ulcerative\n colitis, based on categories pertaining to patient demographics and diagnosed psychological comorbidities, including income level, employment\n status, educational level, age, sex, depression, and anxiety.\n Key Words: ulcerative colitis, patient survey, social determinants of health, disease management, disparities\n\r\n\r\nReceived for publication: December 7, 2022.
