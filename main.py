his is an Elasticsearch index status response. Here's a detailed explanation of its components:

Top Level Structure
_shards: Provides an overview of the shards status.

total: Total number of shards in the index.
successful: Number of shards that are successfully allocated and working.
failed: Number of shards that failed.
indices: Details of the specific indices.

index ID (e.g., "9cf1f92f762b222a1a72792a4c4ba9e9"): Each index is represented by a unique ID. This section provides detailed information about each shard within the index.
Shards Details
Each shard has its own section. The primary components are:

Shard ID (e.g., "0", "1", "2", ...): Each shard has an ID starting from 0.
Shard State Details: Each shard can have one or more copies (primary and replicas).
Shard Copy Details
routing: Information about the shard allocation.

state: The state of the shard (e.g., "STARTED").
primary: Boolean indicating if this shard is a primary shard.
node: The node ID where this shard is located.
num_committed_segments: Number of committed segments in the shard.

num_search_segments: Number of segments that are searchable in the shard.

Segments Details
Each shard contains several segments. Segments are immutable, and new documents are added to new segments.

segment ID (e.g., "_1", "_c", "_d", ...): Each segment has a unique identifier.
generation: The generation number of the segment.
num_docs: Number of documents in the segment.
deleted_docs: Number of deleted documents in the segment.
size_in_bytes: Size of the segment in bytes.
memory_in_bytes: Memory usage of the segment.
committed: Boolean indicating if the segment is committed.
search: Boolean indicating if the segment is searchable.
version: The version of the segment.
compound: Boolean indicating if the segment is a compound file.
attributes: Additional attributes, such as Lucene90StoredFieldsFormat.mode, which indicates the mode used for stored fields.

This pattern continues for each shard in the index, detailing the state and structure of both primary and replica copies of the shards.
