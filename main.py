We evaluated the efficacy and safety of encorafenib plus binimetinib in patients with BRAF mutant metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\t[ ] Editorial, p. 3679 Appendix\n\t\tData Supplement [X] Protocol [X]\nMETHODS\tIn this ongoing, open-label, single-arm, phase II study, patients with BRAF metastatic NSCLC received oral encorafenib 450 mg once daily plus binimetinib 45 mg twice daily in 28-day cycles. The primary end point was confirmed objective response rate (ORR) by independent radiology review (IRR). Secondary end points included duration of response (DOR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival, time to response, and safety.\tAccepted May 4, 2023 Published June 4, 2023 J Clin Oncol 41:3700-3711 © 2023 by American Society of Clinical Oncology\nRESULTS\tAt data cutoff, 98 patients (59 treatment-naive and 39 previously treated) with BRAF metastatic NSCLC received encorafenib plus binimetinib. Median duration of treatment was 9.2 months with encorafenib and 8.4 months with binimetinib. ORR by IRR was 75% (95% CI, 62 to 85) in treatment-naîve and 46% (95% 30 to 63) in previously treated patients; median DOR was not estimable (NE; 95% CI, 23.1 to NE) and 16.7 months (95% CI, 7.4 to NE), re- spectively. DCR after 24 weeks was 64% in treatment-naive and 41% in previously treated patients. Median PFS was NE (95% CI, 15.7 to NE) in treatment-naive and 9.3 months (95% CI, 6.2 to NE) in previously treated patients. The most frequent treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were nausea (50%), diarrhea (43%), and fatigue (32%). TRAEs led to dose reductions in 24 (24%) and permanent dis- continuation of encorafenib plus binimetinib in 15 (15%) patients. One grade 5 TRAE of intracranial hemorrhage was reported.
