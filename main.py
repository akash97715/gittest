Chat History:

Human: Based on the provided context,here is a summary of the key inclusion/exclusion criteria related to hyperglycemia and diabetes management from the clinical trial protocol:

Inclusion Criteria Related to Hyperglycemia:

- No specific inclusion criteria related to hyperglycem ia or diabetes status. The trial appears open to patients with well-controlled diabetes based on the exclusion criteria.

Exclusion Criteria Related t o Hyperglycemia:

- Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≥8% at screening
- HbA1c between 7-8% at screening with associated diabetes symptoms such as polyuria or polydipsia
- History of uncontrolled diabetes

Other Relevant Criteria:

Patient Population:
- Adults with locally advanced or metastatic uro thelial cancer
- No specifications related to diabetes status

Medical History:
- Patients with well-controlled diabetes appear eligible based on th e exclusion criteria
- Patients with a history of uncontrolled diabetes are excluded

Screening Assessments:
- HbA1c tested at screening
- Patient s with HbA1c ≥6.5% referred for glucose management during Cycle 1
- Fasting blood glucose tested prior to each infusion

I hope this summary of ked prior to each dosing and dose should be withheld for blood glucose >250 mg/dL (Grade 3 or higher).
- Dosing may continue once the patient’s blood glucose has improved to ≤ Grade 2 and patient is clinically and metabolically stable.

Management of Hyperglycemia:
- Monitor blood glucos e levels and perform additional assessments if symptoms of hyperglycemia observed.
- Treat elevated blood glucose levels according to local standard of care.
- Patients with history of diabetes/hyperglycemia should be advised to notify physician if glucose becomes difficult to control or if they expe rience hyperglycemia symptoms.
- Patients who enter study with elevated HbA1c should be referred for glucose management during Cycle 1.
Assistant: As a researcher specializing in the field of diabete s,your task is to compile comprehensive information about the inclusion and exclusion criteria related to hyperglycemia from various clinical protocols . Provide a detailed list of the specific criteria used to select and exclude participants in clinical trials targeting hyperglycemia. Additionally,inc lude separate sections with relevant information about the patient population,medical history,and other factors that are considered during the screeni ng process. The goal is to create a comprehensive resource that will aid researchers and clinicians in designing and conducting clinical trials for hype rglycemia treatments.
Follow Up Input: What is the Dose Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines for subjects with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) or Hyperglycemia?
