An application to license 20vPnC for an adult indication in the US was submitted to the FDA on 08 October 2020, and licensure may occur during the conduct of this study. The US ACIP currently has recommendations for 13vPnC, which include vaccination of adults with immunocompromising and other conditions that place them at high risk of pneumococcal disease and a recommendation for immunization in adults 65 years of age and older based on decision making shared between the individual and his or her health care provider.  Recommendations will be considered for 20vPnC after FDA approval.Paragraph text: Pfizer has also developed a vaccine to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 and the disease it causes, COVID-19. Study C4591001 (NCT04368728) is an ongoing Phase 1/2/3 trial in ~44,000 participants ≥12 years of age, designed to generate safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and efficacy data from a novel RNA-based vaccine candidate.  The Phase 2/3 component is assessing the safety and efficacy of two 30-µg doses of BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine (referred to hereafter as BNT162b2) administered 21 days apart, compared to placebo.  Initial safety data through ~14 weeks after the second dose showed a safety profile similar to other viral vaccines; vaccine efficacy was 95% after the second dose and 52% after the first dose.  Additionally, because of unknowns regarding duration of protection, a booster dose of BNT62b2 may be needed; this may be particularly important for older adults, who may be more vulnerable.  An evaluation of a booster dose is currently in progress.Paragraph text: When an individual interacts with a healthcare provider to obtain a COVID-19 vaccination, this may also be an opportunity to administer another recommended vaccine for which the individual may be eligible.  However, because of the current lack of safety and immunogenicity data on COVID-19 vaccines coadministered with other vaccines, current ACIP guidance is that COVID-19 vaccines should be administered alone, with a minimum interval of 14 days before or after administration of any other vaccine.  Therefore, this study describing the safety and immunogenicity of coadministration of a dose of 20vPnC and a booster dose of BNT162b2 will help provide timely data to inform potential concomitant use of those vaccines.Paragraph text: The purpose of this study is to describe the safety and immunogenicity of 20vPnC and a booster dose of BNT162b2 when administered together at the same visit compared to each of the vaccines given alone in adults ≥65 years of age, as shown in Section 1.2.  To be eligible for this study, participants will have participated in Study C4591001 and received 2 doses of 30 µg BNT162b2, with the second dose at least 6 months prior to the first vaccination in this study.Paragraph text: Objectives, Endpoints, and EstimandsParagraph text: Paragraph text: Overall DesignParagraph text: This Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study will be conducted at investigator sites in the US.  The purpose of this study is to describe the safety and immunogenicity of 20vPnC and a booster dose of BNT162b2 when administered together at the same visit compared to each of the vaccines given alone in adults ≥65 years of age, as shown in Section 1.2.  There are no formal comparisons and the study is not designed or powered for hypothesis testing.Paragraph text: Approximately 600 participants from the US, 65 years of age and older who received 2 doses of 30 µg BNT162b2 in Study C4591001, will be stratified by prior pneumococcal vaccine status (no previous pneumococcal vaccine [naïve] or receipt of at least 1 dose of a pneumococcal vaccine [experienced]) and randomized at a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 vaccine groups.Paragraph text: At Visit 1 (Day 1), the Coadministration group (20vPnC+BNT162b2) will receive 20vPnC and a booster dose of BNT162b2, the 20vPnC-only group (20vPnC+saline) will receive 20vPnC and saline, and the BNT162b2-only group (BNT162b2+saline) will receive a booster dose of BNT162b2 and saline.  Since the vaccines and saline have different appearances, they will be administered by an unblinded administrator at each site.Paragraph text: Participants from all groups will have blood drawn at Visit 1 prior to vaccination, and at Visit 2, approximately 1 month after vaccination, for immunogenicity assessments and serological testing for prior COVID-19 infection.Paragraph text: All participants will be contacted by telephone at Month 6 for collection of SAEs.Paragraph text: Local reactions at each injection site and systemic events occurring within 10 days and 7 days after vaccination, respectively, will be collected in an e-diary.  AEs (nonserious AEs and SAEs) will be collected for each participant from the time informed consent is obtained through approximately 1 month after vaccination (Visit 2). SAEs will be collected through approximately 6 months after vaccination.Paragraph text: Number of ParticipantsParagraph text: Approximately 600 participants (200 per group) will be randomly assigned to study intervention.Paragraph text: Intervention Groups and DurationParagraph text: Participants will be randomized at a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 vaccine groups. At Visit 1 (Day 1), the Coadministration group will receive 20vPnC and a booster dose of BNT162b2, the 20vPnC-only group will receive 20vPnC and saline, and the BNT162b2-only group will receive a booster dose of BNT162b2 and saline.  Study intervention will be administered by an unblinded administrator via intramuscular injection to the upper deltoid muscle of each arm.Paragraph text: The duration of the study for each participant is approximately 6 months.Paragraph text: Data Monitoring Committee or Other Independent Oversight Committee: YesParagraph text: This study will use a DMC.  The DMC is independent of the study team and includes only external members.  The DMC charter describes the role of the DMC in more detail.Paragraph text: The DMC will be responsible for ongoing monitoring of the safety of participants in the study according to the charter.  The recommendations made by the DMC to alter the conduct of the study will be forwarded to the appropriate Pfizer personnel for final decision.  Pfizer will forward such decisions, which may include summaries of aggregate analyses of safety data, to regulatory authorities, as appropriate.Paragraph text: Statistical Methods
