To determine how many AWS Lambda instances will be spun up to handle 10,000 requests given that each Lambda instance processes one request at a time, we need to consider both Provisioned Concurrency and On-Demand Concurrency.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown:

Assumptions:
Provisioned Concurrency: You have configured 200 instances.
Request Processing: Each instance processes one request at a time.
Execution Time: Assume the execution time of each request is the same (this will affect the rate at which instances become available).
Steps:
Provisioned Instances Handle Initial Requests:

The first 200 requests are handled by the 200 provisioned instances immediately.
Concurrent Request Handling and Queuing:

The next 9,800 requests (from 201 to 10,000) will be queued as they arrive.
AWS Lambda starts to initialize additional on-demand instances to handle the burst of traffic.
Calculations:
Provisioned Instances (200) handle 200 requests:

Requests 1 to 200 are processed immediately by the provisioned instances.
Remaining Requests (9,800):

For the remaining 9,800 requests, AWS Lambda will initialize additional on-demand instances.
Given that each instance can handle one request at a time, AWS Lambda will need to initialize additional instances to handle the remaining 9,800 requests.

Total Number of Instances:
Provisioned Instances: 200
On-Demand Instances: AWS Lambda will need to spin up enough on-demand instances to handle the remaining requests concurrently.
Since each request needs its own instance (given your constraint that one instance processes one request at a time):

For 9,800 requests, AWS Lambda will spin up 9,800 on-demand instances.
Summary:
Total Lambda Instances Spun Up:
Provisioned Instances: 200
On-Demand Instances: 9,800
Total Instances: 200 + 9,800 = 10,000 instances
Execution Flow:
Requests 1-200:

Processed immediately by 200 provisioned instances.
Requests 201-10,000:

AWS Lambda initializes 9,800 additional on-demand instances to handle these requests concurrently.
Conclusion:
To process 10,000 requests with a Provisioned Concurrency of 200 and each instance processing one request at a time, AWS Lambda will spin up a total of 10,000 instances (200 provisioned + 9,800 on-demand) to handle all the requests concurrently.

is there any limitation with service quota?
ChatGPT
Yes, AWS Lambda has various service quotas (limits) that you need to be aware of when designing and deploying your functions. These limits include the number of concurrent executions, the number of provisioned concurrency, and others. Here are some key quotas relevant to your scenario:

Concurrent Executions
Account-Wide Concurrent Execution Limit:

By default, the account-wide limit for concurrent executions is 1,000 across all functions in a given region.
This means that if you attempt to run more than 1,000 concurrent instances, additional requests will be throttled.
Provisioned Concurrency:

You can configure a specific number of instances to be kept warm with Provisioned Concurrency.
The default limit for Provisioned Concurrency is 300 per function and 3,000 per region.
Increasing Limits
If your application requires more than the default limits, you can request an increase:

Requesting a Quota Increase:
Go to the Service Quotas Console.
Select the quota you want to increase and click "Request quota increase".
Provide the necessary details and justification for the increase.
Example Scenario: 10,000 Requests
Given your scenario of 10,000 concurrent requests and understanding the default quotas:

Provisioned Concurrency:

Default limit: 300 per function.
For 200 provisioned instances, you are within this limit.
Concurrent Executions:

Default limit: 1,000.
You need 10,000 concurrent executions.
This means you need to request an increase to handle 10,000 concurrent executions.
Steps to Handle 10,000 Requests
Check and Increase Quotas:

Verify your current concurrent execution limit.
Request an increase if needed. Aim for at least 10,000 concurrent executions.
Provisioned Concurrency:

Set up 200 provisioned instances (within default or increased limit).
On-Demand Instances:

Ensure your account can handle the remaining 9,800 on-demand instances by increasing the concurrent execution limit.
Managing Throttling
If the concurrent execution limit is reached, additional requests are throttled. AWS Lambda uses a fair queuing system to manage these requests, but it's crucial to ensure your limits are set appropriately to avoid throttling.

Summary
To handle 10,000 concurrent requests:

Provisioned Concurrency:

Set to 200 (default limit is sufficient).
Concurrent Execution Limit:

Default is 1,000.
Request an increase to at least 10,000 to handle all requests without throttling.
Request Quota Increases:

Use the Service Quotas Console to request increases for both provisioned concurrency and concurrent executions.
By managing these quotas and requesting necessary increases, you can ensure your Lambda function can handle the required load efficiently.
