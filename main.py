Multicollinearity \nwas checked, and none of the variation inflation factors were \nabove\xa0 3, so no adjustment was needed. Odds ratios (ORs) \nand 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from multivariate lo-\ngistic regression models measured the relative difference be-\ntween demographic groups, adjusting for other confounders, \nincluding other demographic variables and diagnosed \nconditions. Unweighted data were used for the logistic regres-\nsion due to a large margin of error around the ORs in the \npost-weighted results, which were a result of large weights in \ncountries with higher populations.
